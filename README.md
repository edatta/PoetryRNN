# PoetryRNN

This code is based on the Keras tutorial here:

I've adapted this model to run at the word level (treating spaces and punctuation as "words" as well).  When trained on Yeats, it came up with this masterpiece:

*they had come to the happy. 
and burning , weep for the stars were ancient night west, and the days when away from the isle, woven away, in music of golden beauty. 
a she's heavy heart, the pale glimmering over the thing. 
and woods were gone, and dream i love, and kiss her songs. 
go, always my deer, mind; and the without its their us, to the stars and merry night. 
and, as a grass starry pass; but the sound of the blue star branch there's no dim sound; 
and only hearts are dream her dream? 
o , mortal*
